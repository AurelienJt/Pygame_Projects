---------|To do List|---------

- On turn 1, always adds 1 drawing (so the rope always appear the answer being correct or wrong)
- Never counts the first error (for some reason i mean wtf)
- Make more words (GPT or .js file with modifier dictionnary)
- Limit input to one letters
- Implement high scores (global leaderboard if possible?)

---------|Ideas|---------

- 2 player mode

    1v1, p1 chooses a word and p2 guesses it
    p1 wins if p2 fails
    They exchange positions at the end of a round
    Best of 5 or first to 3 positions

- Endless mode ?
