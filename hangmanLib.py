--------------------------------- Rules ---------------------------------

  - You have to guess a word in a limited amount of errors

  - Each round you guess a letter, if the word contains this letter,
      it will appear instead of a [ _ ] character
      If the character does not match, an error will be counted
  
  - An error is symbolized by the drawing of a hangman gaining limbs

  - Guess the word and win !

  - Win with the fewest errors possible to get the best score !

  - Have fun !
