*This project is aimed to create custom minor 100% python based minigames easily executable on any machine.

## How does it work?

Simply execute the `main.py` file in order to start the program.

## Dependencies

Dependencies correspond to the "libraries" you need to "import". In install all required libraries, use pip3. Current dependencies are:

- pygame

## Roadmaps

**2 player mode**

  - 1v1, p1 chooses a word and p2 guesses it
  - p1 wins if p2 fails
  - They exchange positions at the end of a round
  - Best of 5 or first to 3 positions

### - Endless mode

  - Get the highest score / most rounds
  - Restart with another word when win
  - 3 lives (so 3 deaths) Hangman resets on death/revive (whatever u wanna call it)
  - Make a score system with global highscore board (if possible)
