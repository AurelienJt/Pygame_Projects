### - 2 player mode

  - 1v1, p1 chooses a word and p2 guesses it
  - p1 wins if p2 fails
  - They exchange positions at the end of a round
  - Best of 5 or first to 3 positions

### - Endless mode

  - Get the highest score / most rounds
  - Restart with another word when win
  - 3 lives (so 3 deaths) Hangman resets on death/revive (whatever u wanna call it)
  - Make a score system with global highscore board (if possible)
